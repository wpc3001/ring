## v4.0.0
- Support for Home Assistant Device Registry
- Each device has an "info" sensor updated at least every 5 minutes. State is JSON data with values unique to each device type (battery level, tamper status, AC state, wireless strength, firmware info, serial number, etc)
- Support for monitoring alarm state
  - "Pending" state is equivalent to "entry delay"
  - "Triggered" state is any alarm
  - Detailed alarm state is available via info sensor to get detailed alarm state info:
    - 'entry-delay'
    - 'burglar-alarm'
    - 'fire-alarm'
    - 'co-alarm'
    - 'panic'
    - 'user-verified-burglar-alarm'

    - 'burglar-accelerated-alarm'
  | - 'fire-accelerated-alarm'
- Support for Fire and Polic Panic Buttons
  - *** Should be Used with Caution *** -- Can trigger alarm events with response
  - Can also be used as a high level monitor for burglar or fire alarms (panic state will trigger based on alarm type)
- Support for Base Station
  - Info sensor for monitoring battery/ac status
  - Ability to set volume (requires use of master account as other accounts don't have permission)
- Support for Keypad
  - Info sensor for monitoring batter/ac status, charging state, etc.
  - Ability to set volume
- Basic support for 3rd party Z-wave contact and motion sensors
  - Assumes device is concact sensor unless device name contains the word "motion"
- Significantly enhanced Web UI for token generation (mostly for Home Assistant Addon)
- Improved debug output with more organized location/device discovery output
- Simplified and standardized location/device handling code (still more work to do but becoming far more maintainable)
